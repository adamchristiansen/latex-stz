# LateX Utilities and Styles

I found myself often rewriting the same macros and configurations over and over
again every time I create a new document. This package is my consolidated set
of utilities and opinionated set of styles and tweaks.

The [`stz.sty`](./stz.sty) file is the entire package. The
[`main.tex`](./main.tex) document illustrates some of the features of the
package.
